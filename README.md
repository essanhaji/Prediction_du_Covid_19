# Covid-19 Classifier

Hi,
<br>
<br>
This notebook is hand on the practice of data preprocessing pipeline. In this note we use metadata of another dataset that use for classifying covid-19 and no-covid-19 cases in CSV format a variable [here](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset/blob/master/metadata.csv) and we will use it as our primary one. This will be the most worst case that maybe you will do in the data preparation process.
<br>
<br>
This is the best example of the most famous quote "garbage in, garbage out " for you training step that this little dataset has a bunch of missing values and outliers and meaningless values.
<br>
<br>
This notebook written in French language for some reason.
