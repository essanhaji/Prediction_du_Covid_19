# Covid-19 Classifier

This notebook is hand on the practice of data preprocessing pipeline. In this note we use metadata of another dataset that use for classifying covid-19 and no-covid-19 cases in CSV format a variable [here](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset/blob/master/metadata.csv) and we will use it as our primary one. This will be the most worst case that maybe you will do in the data preparation process.


This is the best example of the most famous quote "garbage in, garbage out " for you training step that this little dataset has a bunch of missing values and outliers and meaningless values.


This notebook written in French language for some reason.
